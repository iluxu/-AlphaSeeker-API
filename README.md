Okay, let's inject some more excitement and appeal into the README.md to grab attention, while still keeping the important disclaimers. We'll focus on the potential and the "AI" aspect, using stronger verbs and highlighting the key value propositions.

# AlphaSeeker API üöÄ - Your AI-Powered Crypto Market Scanner & Analysis Engine

**Unlock potential trading opportunities in the fast-paced crypto markets with the AlphaSeeker API!** This powerful FastAPI backend leverages technical analysis, statistical modeling, and cutting-edge AI (GPT-4o) to scan Binance Futures, evaluate signals, and identify potential setups based on your custom criteria.

**Version:** 1.4.1 (Corrected technical trigger logic, disabled LSTM)

**‚ö°Ô∏è Go Beyond Simple Alerts - Get AI-Evaluated Insights! ‚ö°Ô∏è**

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT WARNING / DISCLAIMER:**
*   **EXPERIMENTAL TOOL:** This software is for educational and experimental purposes ONLY. It's a tool to explore strategy ideas, **NOT a guaranteed profit machine.**
*   **HIGH RISK:** Cryptocurrency trading involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for every investor. **This is NOT financial advice.**
*   **BACKTEST LIMITATIONS:** Included backtests are based on simplified proxy triggers (RSI) and **DO NOT reflect real-world costs or guarantee future results.**
*   **AI IS NOT INFALLIBLE:** GPT evaluations depend on prompt quality and data provided. They can be imperfect or wrong. Critical thinking is required.
*   **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.** The author is not responsible for any financial losses. Always conduct thorough Due Diligence and Your Own Research (DYOR).

## üî• Key Features

*   **Blazing Fast Scans:** Asynchronously analyze hundreds of Binance USDT perpetual futures using CCXT.
*   **Comprehensive TA:** Calculates a wide array of indicators (RSI, SMAs, EMAs, MACD, Bollinger Bands, ATR, ADX, & more).
*   **Volatility Insights:** Utilizes GARCH(1,1) and VaR for risk context.
*   **Intelligent Signal Triggering:** Combines indicators (currently RSI + SMA Trend + ADX) to pinpoint initial potential setups.
*   **ü§ñ AI-Powered Evaluation (GPT-4o Ready):** Sends triggered signals to OpenAI's GPT for an in-depth evaluation against the full market picture:
    *   Confirms or rejects initial signals based on confluence or contradictions.
    *   Suggests tactical **entry, stop-loss, and take-profit** levels.
    *   Provides an **AI confidence score** for evaluated setups.
*   **Proxy Backtesting:** Get a quick historical perspective with a built-in (simplified RSI-based) backtester.
*   **Deeply Customizable Filtering:** Filter scan results by GPT confidence, backtest score, R/R ratio, trade count, win rate, profit factor, ADX, SMA alignment, and more!
*   **Clean FastAPI Interface:** Easy to integrate and interact with via a REST API.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Quick Start

1.  **Prerequisites:** Python 3.8+, OpenAI API Key.
2.  **Clone:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your_github_repo_url>
    cd AlphaSeeker-API
    ```
3.  **Setup Environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate | macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
4.  **Add API Key:** Edit the `.env` file and paste your OpenAI key:
    ```dotenv
    OPENAI_API_KEY="your_real_openai_api_key_here"
    ```
    *(Remember: Keep your `.env` file secure and out of Git!)*
5.  **Run the Beast!** (Make sure your script is named `main_api.py`)
    ```bash
    uvicorn main_api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8029 --reload
    ```
6.  **Explore:** Open your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:8029/docs` for the interactive API docs (Swagger UI).

## ‚öôÔ∏è API Endpoints

*   **`GET /api/crypto/tickers`**: Get the list of scannable Binance USDT-M perpetuals.
*   **`POST /api/crypto/analyze`**: Deep-dive analysis on a single symbol.
*   **`POST /api/crypto/scan`**: Unleash the market scanner! Customize filters in the request body (`ScanRequest`) to find opportunities matching *your* criteria.

## Understanding the Workflow

1.  **Data Fetch & TA:** Gets historical data and calculates all indicators.
2.  **Technical Trigger:** Checks if the current state meets predefined technical conditions (e.g., RSI + Trend + ADX).
3.  **AI Evaluation (Conditional):** *If* a technical trigger fires, it asks GPT to evaluate the signal's strength, considering all indicators, and suggest trade parameters.
4.  **Proxy Backtest:** Runs a simple RSI-based backtest for historical context (independent of GPT's evaluation).
5.  **Filtering & Ranking:** Applies *your* filters (`ScanRequest`) to the results and ranks the survivors.

## Limitations & The Road Ahead

AlphaSeeker is a powerful starting point, but remember:

*   Finding consistent "alpha" is the holy grail - this tool aids the search but doesn't guarantee discovery.
*   The default technical trigger is just one example; experimentation is encouraged!
*   GPT's effectiveness is tied to prompt engineering and the quality of the input data.
*   Backtest scores are simplified proxies.

**Future Ideas:** More trigger strategies, enhanced backtesting (fees, slippage, drawdown), more sophisticated filtering, alternative AI models.

Key Changes for Appeal:

Catchy Title & Emojis: "AlphaSeeker API üöÄ", "‚ö°Ô∏è", "üî•", "ü§ñ", "‚öôÔ∏è" add visual interest.

Stronger Opening: Emphasizes unlocking opportunities and AI power.

Benefit-Oriented Features: Phrased features more around what the user gains (e.g., "Blazing Fast Scans", "Intelligent Signal Triggering", "AI-Powered Evaluation").

Action Verbs: Used words like "Unlock", "Unleash", "Deep-dive".

Clear Call to Action: Simplified the running instructions.

Roadmap Hint: Briefly mentioned future possibilities to show ongoing potential.

Retained Disclaimers: Kept the crucial warnings prominent (using ‚ö†Ô∏è emoji).

Remember to replace <your_github_repo_url> in the README with the actual URL after you create the repository and push the code. Good luck!
